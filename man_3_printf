.TH _PRINTF 3 "2024-11-19" "Holberton School" "Custom Printf Manual"
.SH NAME
_printf \- custom implementation of the printf function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include "main.h"
.PP
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B _printf
function produces output according to a
.I format
as described below.
This function writes output to stdout, the standard output stream.
.PP
The
.I format
string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. 
The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not
.BR % ),
which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.
.PP
Each conversion specification is introduced by the character
.BR % ,
and ends with a conversion specifier. In between there may be (in this order):
.IP \(bu 3
Zero or more flags (currently not implemented)
.IP \(bu 3
An optional field width (currently not implemented)
.IP \(bu 3
An optional precision (currently not implemented)
.IP \(bu 3
An optional length modifier (currently not implemented)
.IP \(bu 3
A conversion specifier
.PP
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.B d, i
The
.BR int
argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B c
The
.BR int
argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B s
The
.BR char *
argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). 
Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\e0').
If the pointer is NULL, the string "(null)" is printed.
.TP
.B %
A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, the
.B _printf
function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
.PP
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following example demonstrates the use of
.BR _printf :
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
#include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
    int count;
    
    count = _printf("Hello, %s!\\n", "World");
    _printf("Printed %d characters\\n", count);
    
    _printf("Number: %d, Negative: %i\\n", 42, -42);
    _printf("Character: %c\\n", 'A');
    _printf("Percent sign: %%\\n");
    
    return (0);
}
.EE
.in
.PP
This program will output:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
Hello, World!
Printed 13 characters
Number: 42, Negative: -42
Character: A
Percent sign: %
.EE
.in
.SH CONFORMING TO
This custom implementation is designed for educational purposes and is not intended to be fully compatible with any specific standard.
.SH BUGS
This implementation does not support:
.IP \(bu 3
Flag characters (#, 0, -, +, space)
.IP \(bu 3
Field width specification
.IP \(bu 3
Precision specification
.IP \(bu 3
Length modifiers (h, l, L)
.IP \(bu 3
Floating-point conversions (f, F, e, E, g, G, a, A)
.IP \(bu 3
Other conversion specifiers (u, o, x, X, p, n)
